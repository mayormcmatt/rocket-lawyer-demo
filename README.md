# All Engines Go For Rocket Lawyer

### Hello, Lucas and the Rocket Lawyer Team!

I was excited to speak with you today (Monday) and hope this meets your expectations.

Please view the results at [at this GitHub Pages site.](https://mayormcmatt.github.io/rocket-lawyer-demo/)

#### Notes about build

- No framework used; only CSS3/SCSS, though I'm happy to use Bootstrap (as it's present on Rocket Lawyer pages)
- The main.css file is compiled SCSS, so it will look like madness; check /styles for the raw SCSS
- Used dummy Lorem Ipsum above and below the bar, as I though it looked odd floating alone, in mid-air; this added to
  the complexity of CSS, maybe 40 - 50 lines
- Normally I might use BEM for organization, but there wasn't enough meat to really warrant much use of it here
- I did not style below the 320px breakpoint because there are no devices on the market that small
- RL uses 300 weight Open Sans for titles and copy; comp is more like 700 and 400 weight, respectively. I did
  my best to match
- Used box shadow for lower "border" of upper section for the phone breakpoint, though it resembles a border
- Icons in tablet viewport on actual RL site are a tad smaller in width than in the comps; appear further spaced out.
- Although instructed not to bother with the SVG fills, I did anyway (it was quick)

## Thank you!
