# All Engines Go For Rocket Lawyer

- Rocket Lawyer uses 300 weight Open Sans for titles and copy; comp is more like 700 and 400 weight, respectively.
- SVG fills needed to be adjusted to shades of orange; I have adjusted to approximate the shades.

#### Notes about the two mobile layouts
- Used box shadow for lower "border" of upper section, though it resembles a border

#### Notes about the iPad/tablet layout
- Icons in tablet viewport on actual RL site are a tad smaller in width than in the comps; appear further spaced out.
